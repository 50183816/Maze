The class Maze represents the maze object. It has propertiese like size, start point , passages etc. And a factory pattern is used to create maze using different algorithm.

Currently it support generating maze with size 8X8,16X16,32X32 and 64X64, but is can be extended if changing the MazeSize enum from the MazeLib project.

After building and runing the application, from the UI by click the maze size buttons the maze will be generated and shown.
